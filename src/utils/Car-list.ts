The car runs great with no engine issues; however, it does need new brakes and front struts. Also, the driver side slide door for the second row does not open automatically. Everything else works fine. I have all the maintenance records. Recently replaced AC compressor, timing belt, water pump, spark plugs, car starter and installed 4 new Michelin tires at 116K miles. The tires still have around 50K miles left. The car is clean inside and out. There is some rust as shown in pictures, which is normal for the car's age. No delivery available and cash offers only.",
